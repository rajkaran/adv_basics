# adv basics
This is an app I created while learning Flutter application development. I built this app by following a Udemy tutorial created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. Below is a list of some of the major features and techniques I learned while building this app:
* Add icon to button
* Creating a Stateful widget
* Showing content conditionally
* Accepting and passing functions as values
* Flutter's (Stateful) Widget Lifecycle
* Creating a Reusable, Custom Styled Button
* Type casting
* Maps & "for" Loops in Flutter
*  Filtering & Analyzing Lists
*  Debugging app
